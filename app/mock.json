For me, the pre-selected persistence provider is now &amp;quot;EclipseLink(JPA 2.0)(default)&amp;quot;. [As an aside, this is still not quite correct, as for WLS it should be JPA 2.0, and currently persistence.xml is incorrectly generated as version 2.0. But that&amp;apos;s a separate problem.]\n\nAfter this, the JPA dependencies are added to the classpath. I would assume that the IDE is looking at the pom volume of the JPA provider library, right? So if it can not determine what is the default provider, it does not know what to add.\n\nSo, you are saying you can still reproduce? What is the exact behavior for you?*`|`*","sj-nb*`|`*Sergey Petrov*`|`*2010-08-17T08:41:44Z*`|`*&amp;gt;After this, the JPA dependencies are added to the classpath. I would assume\nthat the IDE is looking at the pom volume of the JPA provider library, right?\n\nFor ant project, default provider libraries(if available) are added to processors classpath only, in case of maven addition to processors classpath seems to add dependencies to usual classpath. Is it really required to fix {subj}? Does it mean behavior should be differnt for ant/maven or I miss something and api is added in case of ant?*`|`*","sj-nb*`|`*Sergey Petrov*`|`*2010-08-18T07:38:31Z*`|`*Just verified it&amp;apos;s really on compile classpath in maven instead of just processor classpath.

Is it an option?*`|`*","pjiricka*`|`*Petr Jiricka*`|`*2010-08-26T13:59:29Z*`|`*&amp;gt; Is it really required to fix {subj}?\n\nNot necessarily, I think this could stay as it is now if it does not cause user visible problems.\n\n&amp;gt; Does it mean behavior should be different for ant/maven\n\nPossibly. Ant and Maven are different build systems, so the behavior could be different.\n\n&amp;gt; In my opinion, jpa api should be in dependencies right after project creation\n&amp;gt; as it&amp;apos;s in javaee6 and as it&amp;apos;s for servlets and jsps api. Is it an option?\n\nI don&amp;apos;t think this would be too helpful. The nature of Maven is that you are allowed to add any dependencies in pom, and the IDE must be able to read in your project and work with it. So we would still need to count with projects that do not have JPA API on the classpath. In fact, some people say that we should go back to the fine granularity of individual Java EE APIs and not have the monolitic ee6-api and ee6-web-api jar files. I know that Spring is packaging Java EE APIs in their Maven repository, and they are doing it this way.\n\nAnyway, since the original report is fixed, I am marking this as fixed.

I&amp;apos;d ask Martin Grebac on his opinion.\n\nThe JAXB wizard is just accidentally running in Maven projects. Nobody implemented it yet for Maven specifically.\n\nAt least these steps should be done:\n\n- xml schema files should be included to src/main/resources directory\n- maven-jaxb-plugin (or maven-jaxb2-plugin) should be included to pom file\n\nWe may omit to implement UI changes (nodes, actions) in Maven project for JAXB.\nThe wizard may just put all schema files to src/main/resources and generate one generic plugin execution, or (may be better) to generate specific plugin execution for each xsd.\n\nSample :\n&amp;lt;plugin&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;com.sun.tools.xjc.maven2&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;maven-jaxb-plugin&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;executions&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;execution&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;goals&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;goal&amp;gt;generate&amp;lt;/goal&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/goals&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;generatePackage&amp;gt;org.example.po1&amp;lt;/generatePackage&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;includeSchemas&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;includeSchema&amp;gt;po1/*.xsd&amp;lt;/includeSchema&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/includeSchemas&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;id&amp;gt;Po1&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/execution&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;execution&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;goals&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;goal&amp;gt;generate&amp;lt;/goal&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/goals&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;generatePackage&amp;gt;org.example.po2&amp;lt;/generatePackage&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;includeSchemas&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;includeSchema&amp;gt;po2/*.xsd&amp;lt;/includeSchema&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/includeSchemas&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;id&amp;gt;Po2&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/execution&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/executions&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/plugin&amp;gt;*`|`*","mkuchtiak*`|`*Milan Kuchtiak*`|`*2010-08-18T08:39:10Z*`|`*I checked both the maven-jaxb-plugin(1) and maven-jaxb2-plugin(2).\n*`|`*","jglick*`|`*Jesse Glick*`|`*2010-08-18T16:55:37Z*`|`*(In reply to comment #3)\n&amp;gt; maven-jaxb2-plugin [...] generates some jaxb bindings (sun-jaxb.episode)\n&amp;gt; to META-INF directory.\n\nYes, this seems to be to support multiple-episode compilation, mentioned somewhere in its documentation.

However an option (in the View menu?) to force all tabs/spaces to be shown would be useful too.\n\nNote, This might need to be coordinated with the existing &amp;quot;Format&amp;quot; tool, so that the editor and Format agree on what looks &amp;quot;unexpected&amp;quot;.\n\n&amp;lt;opinion&amp;gt;Netbeans has so many impressive editing features that the mere existence of this rather basic feature request seems odd.  Hopefully it can be given a greater priority.  These &amp;quot;intelligent&amp;quot; features are needed (expected?) in a source code editor... they set an IDE apart from a plain text editor, like &amp;apos;vi&amp;apos;.  &amp;lt;/opinion&amp;gt;*`|`*","ericjs*`|`**`|`*2010-02-18T08:44:19Z*`|`*I think janicki&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;highlight unexpected&amp;quot;feature (Comment #25) is a great idea. However I think it should be a part of language-specific highlighting built on top of whatever editor support is added to show non-visible spaces in the first place, with each option individually selectable, and independent of the editor-general show tabs &amp;amp; spaces / show line endings features. I think this should be a separate feature request.\n\n(BTW, this may not be common, but some people DO use tabs mid-line to line up elements in their code, like multi-line comments that fall after code lines, variable names in a list of declarations, array. This may be more common in some languages than others.)*`|`*","grantb*`|`*grantb*`|`*2010-02-18T08:54:31Z*`|`*I seconded ericjs&amp;apos;s reply.\n\nLet this bug just be about a basic show-non-visible-characters mode that can be used by everyone, no matter what the language or mode.*`|`*","amites*`|`**`|`*2010-02-18T09:34:54Z*`|`*Given the age of this feature request for &amp;quot;basic&amp;quot; level support I don&amp;apos;t see adding &amp;quot;nice to have&amp;quot; ideas as the best way to get it moving forward\n\nseems there would be atleast 1 Java developer with a couple hours to come up with a way to implement this - adding in bells and whistles takes that couple hours and turns into a couple days which is far less likely...\n\njust my 2 cents - anyone consider getting a pool of money together to contribute to anyone that fixes/adds a given bug/feature??\n\nI know of a few web-sites that offer this feature though none pop into mind.

The only way to work around it is to actively poll the state. This of course may miss some updates of state, however it is not really important as we really care about the final state and final message. At least in this particular case. Perhaps we could use JMX redeploy bean in future however it is deprecated.\n\nThe plugin code is getting bit messy. Luckily these workarounds are isolated and hopefully we will have some time to do the things in a cleaner way.\n\nThe good thing is that the redeployment is now faster (cached DM) - at least for me :)\n\nAttaching patch for now.

The EE 6 container constructs and Jersey managed the life-cycle, but the restriction here is that constructor injection of JAX-RS artifacts are not supported\n\nThere are different restrictions when one uses CDI because the JAX-RS model and CDI model are slightly different.\n\nIt can be summarized as thus: JAX-RS specifies a programming model and if by default components were considered managed beans would break code.

Thanks.\nThe copy/paste issue still waiting for JDK team&amp;apos;s response.\n\nSince this issue filed to JDK is not public,\nI would like to talk about something more here that are connected to fix this issue.\n\nfontconfig.properties settings released with JDK (at least up to 1.6.0_18)\ndoes not supports displaying of the supplementary characters.\n\nSome Chinese characters are introduced as supplementary characters.\nAFAIK, on Windows Vista and Windows 7, supplementary characters are provided apart from BMPs.\nFor example, on a Simplified Chinese environment for most mainland China users,\nSimSun is for BMPs and SimSun-ExtB is for supplementary characters.\n(Also MingLiU / MingLiU-ExtB for Taiwan users, MingLiU_HKSCS / MingLiU_HKSCS-ExtB for Hong Kong users).\n\nAnd there are some ethnic minorities&amp;apos; language as Yi Syllables were introduced too.\nOn Windows 7, these characters can be found in the Microsoft Yi Baiti font.\n\nJava requires a Unicode font containing all sorts of characters to make display behavior well.\nIf there is a character lack in the font, the character could not display properly.\nInstead of this, most operating systems uses a smarter way (or called Font Linking?) to do this.\nIt falls back to another linked font, if current font doesn&amp;apos;t contain the character,\nwhich makes an application easier to render its output,\nregardless of the fonts that users actually choose to use.\n\nBesides, It doesn&amp;apos;t seem possible to find a font that is full of all Unicode characters today,\nso I think it is a perfect way to solve this problem,\nextremely helpful on i18n or complex desktop applications.\n\nOn Windows, Java also provides four pre-defined logical fonts which are combined by several physical fonts.\nBut neither it can be controlled or add/modified by the application.\nAnd it affects all applications which is harmful to particular UI customization or personalization for only one application.\n\nEclipse/SWT uses native controls, so applications built on SWT remain good looking on a Chinese OS,\nsince Windows eventually falls back to SimSun no matter what font your choose,\neven Verdana / Consolas which contains no more other than Latin.\nBut I have to stand the bad looking of Swing applications, otherwise undisplayable character would come out.\nJava doesn&amp;apos;t do a fallback.\n\nThis issue has been submitted to Sun for over 3 years\nhttp://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6407157,\nbut no further response is done so far.\n\nHopefully Sun would take seriously on this issue.*`|`*","johnsonlau*`|`*johnsonlau*`|`*2009-09-08T16:57:22Z*`|`*Created attachment 87300\n*`|`*87300","vstejskal*`|`*Vitezslav Stejskal*`|`*2009-09-09T08:18:27Z*`|`*Thanks for the patch.

Still, you can not just simply replace the compiler version with 2.2, because if the project has some tests, the processor will try to find persistence.xml in test sources, and fail. So if test sources do not have persistence.xml, the plugin has to be configured so processors are run during sources compilation, but not during test sources compilation:\n\n&amp;lt;plugin&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;maven-compiler-plugin&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;2.2&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;executions&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;execution&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;id&amp;gt;default-compile&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;source&amp;gt;1.6&amp;lt;/source&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;target&amp;gt;1.6&amp;lt;/target&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/execution&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;execution&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;id&amp;gt;default-testCompile&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;compilerArgument&amp;gt;-proc:none&amp;lt;/compilerArgument&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;source&amp;gt;1.6&amp;lt;/source&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;target&amp;gt;1.6&amp;lt;/target&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/execution&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/executions&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/plugin&amp;gt;\n\nThis is still not quite clean, because what if the test sources do contain some other processor that you *do* want to run?

Here are the instructions on how to configure metamodel generation with Maven:\n\n----------------------\nConfiguring and using within Maven\n\nUse the following proceduce to configure the metamodel generation with Maven:\n1. Use EclipseLink version 2.1.0-SNAPSHOT. Versions prior to this do not work well in some situations.\n2. Add the modelgen jar to your project&amp;apos;s dependencies.\n3. Use maven-compiler-plugin version 2.2. Earlier versions do not work.\n4. Make sure java source version is set to 1.6\n\nMaven pom file example:\n\nDeclaring maven-compiler-plugin in the plugins section:\n\n&amp;lt;plugin&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;maven-compiler-plugin&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;2.2&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;source&amp;gt;1.6&amp;lt;/source&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;target&amp;gt;1.6&amp;lt;/target&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/plugin&amp;gt;\n\nDeclaring the EclipseLink Maven repository in the repositories section:\n\n&amp;lt;repository&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;url&amp;gt;http://ftp.ing.umu.se/mirror/eclipse/rt/eclipselink/maven.repo&amp;lt;/url&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;id&amp;gt;eclipselink&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;layout&amp;gt;default&amp;lt;/layout&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;Repository for library EclipseLink&amp;lt;/name&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/repository&amp;gt;\n\nDeclaring dependencies on the EclipseLink artefacts:\n\n&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.eclipse.persistence&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;eclipselink&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;2.1.0-SNAPSHOT&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.eclipse.persistence&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.modelgen.processor&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;2.1.0-SNAPSHOT&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;scope&amp;gt;compile&amp;lt;/scope&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.eclipse.persistence&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;javax.persistence&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;2.0.0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;*`|`*","sj-nb*`|`*Sergey Petrov*`|`*2010-05-04T15:59:30Z*`|`*1 and 2 can be done on persistence side and I hope should work the same in ant and in maven.\n4. for is user actions dependent and in my opinion should be controlled by users manually.\n3. how I enforce usage of proper maven-compiler-plugin?*`|`*","pjiricka*`|`*Petr Jiricka*`|`*2010-05-04T19:25:48Z*`|`*1 and 2 - agree.\n4 - agree.

But Java SE may not be such a high priority.*`|`*","rjdkolb*`|`**`|`*2010-05-10T09:40:57Z*`|`*add cc\n*`|`*","rjdkolb*`|`**`|`*2010-05-10T11:20:31Z*`|`*Generating Canonical MetaModel classes in OpenJPA 2.0 (final)\n\nhttp://openjpa.apache.org/builds/2.0.0/apache-openjpa-2.0.0/docs/manual/ch13s04.html*`|`*","pjiricka*`|`*Petr Jiricka*`|`*2010-05-11T12:52:46Z*`|`*Regarding item 3 - cc&amp;apos;ing Dafe as the owner of the Maven archetypes.

But there are still problems:\n- EclipseLink library incorrectly declares the processor jar file - it should refer to org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.modelgen.processor, not org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.modelgen.\n- For web projects, EclipseLink needs to be added to the processor classpath (for Java SE projects, EL is already in the compilation classpath, so this is not a problem). The Maven project currently does not handle processor classpath - it needs to be modified.\n\nI am attaching a patch that fixes these two problems. Sergey and Dafe, can you please review it? Thanks.*`|`*99669","sj-nb*`|`*Sergey Petrov*`|`*2010-05-31T14:03:10Z*`|`*thanks for resource fix, I see you introduce processor path usage, but I see no changes related to properties  ui and processor path configuration, is it expected?\n*`|`*","pjiricka*`|`*Petr Jiricka*`|`*2010-05-31T14:46:21Z*`|`*You are right, there is no UI, which creates inconsistency with Ant projects - thanks for raising this point.\nWhat would the UI look like? I think the minimal possible UI is an enable/disable checbox. On the other hand, I think in Maven, having the UI is less critical than in Ant, because it is very easy to disable the processor e.g. by adding\n&amp;lt;compilerArgument&amp;gt;-proc:none&amp;lt;/compilerArgument&amp;gt;\nto the compiler plugin. Also other configuration changes can be done easily by manually editing the pom file. So I think the UI does not need to be a part of this change, but we should create a separate issue to track it. The editing support (code completion etc.) is not implemented, so that too should be tracked separately. What do you think (both Sergey and Dafe)?*`|`*","sj-nb*`|`*Sergey Petrov*`|`*2010-06-01T11:58:31Z*`|`*I&amp;apos;m not so good with maven, so only basic overview of your changeset was done.\nIf I got it right only services regstration of ap will work with your changet without ability to specify specific classes as in ant project, isn&amp;apos;t it?\nRegarding manual editing of pom, in ant based project it also possible to add proc:none to additional compiler options but also there is checkbox. Also ui related issue is where user will see processor classpath dependencies. But it can be a separate issue.*`|`*","dsimonek*`|`*David Simonek*`|`*2010-06-15T13:46:14Z*`|`*Hi,\nFrom Maven sources point of view, fix is fine, no complaints.\n\nOn UI side, I don&amp;apos;t know the domain enough to be able to give an idea. Generally, our goal is to build Maven UI the same as Ant support UI where it is possible. But at the same time, there are several places where Maven supports lacks UI compared to Ant support.

But if there is a warning which covers an error, then Next must be disabled, because you can not ignore the error. And when there is a warning that does not allow you to proceed, user will be wondering why she can not progress, as she does not see the error.

First one was just problem description and what outcome I expected.\n\nUser needs to be &amp;quot;warn&amp;quot; different way - for example by having an option to fetch data sources which in turn results in server selection (I&amp;apos;m not sure how feasible it is to start Maven server selection dialog from JPA module - probably tricky). Advantage of this approach is that we do not have to warn user - they are given clear options in UI to follow.\n\n(In reply to comment #2)\n&amp;gt; one possible solution is to combine errors with warnings in one text\n\nyou could always add label at the bottom of you wizard panel which displays warning text+icon and show it only when appropriate but warning/error driven UI is not that good workflow.*`|`*","sj-nb*`|`*Sergey Petrov*`|`*2010-09-01T11:29:53Z*`|`*Addition of one more text label will make wizard height bigger and if avoid height jumping in case there is a problem vs now problem, it will mean a lot of empty space.

Have a look at attached patch. It basically enables Data Sources combo box when server is not selected (primary in Maven projects) and combo contain only one item &amp;quot;Fetch from Server&amp;quot;. Choosing that item opens &amp;quot;Set Deployment Derver&amp;quot; dialog and if user chooses a server and returns back to wizard then list of Data Sources is refreshed. What do you think about such approach?\n\nI like it. The only think I wonder is whether user still may have a need to create new DB connection and whether the second radio button should be enabled.*`|`*","dkonecny*`|`*David Konecny*`|`*2010-09-02T01:55:52Z*`|`*Created attachment 101815\n*`|`*101815","quality*`|`*Quality Engineering*`|`*2010-09-02T03:18:39Z*`|`*Integrated into &amp;apos;main-golden&amp;apos;, will be available in build *201009020000* on http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/nightly/ (upload may still be in progress)\nChangeset: http://hg.netbeans.org/main/rev/4c838beb6256\nUser: Sergey B.

a need for another small improvement. The\nissue 40738 solves problems with reading improper\ncontent of a file when it is being written, but\nthere is often a chance that one could read a file\nbefore it is being written to. Right now one can\ncreate new data file:\n\nFileObject fo = FileUtil.createData (...);\n\nand only then can lock the file and obtain the\noutput stream:\n\nfo.getOutputStream (fo.getLock ());\n\nduring this time another object can grab the\nstream and try to read from this, not yet\ninitialize file. In order to solve this an API\nextension is proposed:\n\nfinal class FileUtil.OpenedHandle {\npublic final FileObject file;\npublic final FileLock lock;\npublic final OutputStream os;\n}\n\nOpenedHandle FileUtil.createOpenedData (...);\n\nthat would create a data file, locked it and\nreturned an output stream to write to it. The file\ncreated event should probably be fired only after\nthe stream is closed. If clients used this method,\nthey could safely assume that no other part of\ninfrastructure is reading their files prior they\nare fully finished.","comment":["jglick*`|`*Jesse Glick*`|`*2004-03-08T12:08:42Z*`|`*BTW suggest that FileUtil be reserved for convenience methods and that\nthe proposed class be put elsewhere.\n\nSeems like this and issue #40738 are just special cases of the need\nfor a proper threading model (and lock system) for Filesystems. IMHO\nwe could probably just synchronize all Filesystems methods on a single\nlock and get reasonable performance and a much simpler API and impl,\nfor example.*`|`*","ttran*`|`*_ ttran*`|`*2004-07-11T20:39:51Z*`|`*-&amp;gt; future, not for D of course\n*`|`*","anebuzelsky*`|`*Antonin Nebuzelsky*`|`*2008-04-15T17:13:29Z*`|`*Reassigning to new module owner jskrivanek.\n*`|`*","jtulach*`|`*Jaroslav Tulach*`|`*2010-04-27T15:47:24Z*`|`*If this shall be implemented then I suggest:\n\nFileUtil.createAndOpen(..., AtomicReference&amp;lt;FileObject&amp;gt; file, AtomicReference&amp;lt;FileLock&amp;gt; lock, AtomicReference&amp;lt;OutputStream&amp;gt; os);\n\nbut unless really needed, there is no big reason to implement this method nobody is going to use in near future.*`|`*","jglick*`|`*Jesse Glick*`|`*2010-04-27T19:07:20Z*`|`*A simpler signature would be something like\n\npublic final OutputStream [FileObject.]createAndOpen(String child);\n\ne.g.\n\nDocument doc = ...;\nFileObject folder = ...;\nOutputStream os = folder.createAndOpen(&amp;quot;newfile.xml&amp;quot;);\ntry {\nXMLUtil.write(doc, os, &amp;quot;UTF-8&amp;quot;);\n} finally {\nos.close();\n}\n\nThis would be used quite widely, I think. Currently you have to not only create the new FileObject as a separate step, but also wrap the whole block in an AtomicAction, which is rather clumsy. This pattern (sometimes forgetting the AtomicAction) is repeated many times throughout project system code.*`|`*","jtulach*`|`*Jaroslav Tulach*`|`*2010-04-28T07:48:59Z*`|`*Sounds much better.\n*`|`*","jglick*`|`*Jesse Glick*`|`*2010-04-28T18:58:29Z*`|`*Is there an easy way to ensure that the FileCreatedEvent is fired only after OutputStream.close() is called? Wrapping the body of createAndOpen in an AtomicAction of course will not suffice, since the stream is closed after this method returns. And just suppressing the FileCreatedEvent (permitting the FileModifiedEvent to be fired upon stream close) is not good since some listeners may be checking only for FCE.
